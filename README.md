  **My personal journey through Data Structures and Algorithms using Python**
</div>

After previously learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Java, I'm now revisiting these concepts with a Pythonic approach.
This repository documents my learning process as I tackle carefully selected DSA problems. I'm sharing my progress publicly to stay accountable and, hopefully, to help others on similar journeys.

> 🎯 **Goal**: Build robust problem-solving skills in Python, advancing systematically from fundamental to advanced DSA concepts.

## 📋 About This Journey

This repository serves as a long-term preparation for coding interviews, with a target of securing a software engineering role by 2027. Although that may seem far away, I am taking a proactive approach to build my problem-solving skills early. I plan to venture into various DSA concepts, continuously refining my understanding through consistent practice.

My goal is to develop a robust foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms using Python, building on my previous experience with Java. Each solution includes:

* **Clean, well-documented code** with Pythonic practices
* **Detailed thought process** and approach explanation
* **Complexity analysis** (time and space)
* **Alternative solutions** when applicable
* **Reflections** on challenges and learning takeaways

## 📚 Study Approach

I follow a methodical learning process:

1. **Understand the concept** - Study the underlying theory
2. **Implement from scratch** - Write my own implementation without references
3. **Optimize** - Refine for efficiency and readability
4. **Generalize** - Identify patterns for future application
5. **Review** - Periodic revision of previously solved problems

### Weekly Focus Areas

Each week focuses on:
- 🧩 **Core concept** (e.g., Recursion, Trees)
- 🔄 **Implementation variations**
- 🔗 **Connections to related problems**
- 📈 **Progressive difficulty increase**

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Framework

For each problem, I follow this structured approach:

1. **Understand** - Clarify inputs, outputs, constraints
2. **Visualize** - Draw examples, identify patterns
3. **Brute Force** - Develop initial working solution
4. **Optimize** - Improve algorithm efficiency
5. **Implement** - Write clean, documented code
6. **Test** - Verify with multiple test cases
7. **Reflect** - Document learnings and alternate approaches

## 🗒️ Learning Journal

Each implementation includes a learning journal with:
